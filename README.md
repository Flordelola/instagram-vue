# Instagram app with VueJs

Since we are stuck at home due to the COVID19 regulations, why not use my time to code and use VueJs to do my first app, and why not an IG app?

Thanks to this [tutorial](https://github.com/VueVixensESP/vuevixens-instagram) by the amazing [@VueVixensESP](https://github.com/VueVixensESP) community I have been able to spend a lovely sunday evening
